# FRSSA-ASST-Augmentation
Implementations of FRSSA augmentation (Pre-Splitting and Post-Splitting) with ASST for Sepsis Mortality

This repository provides code and custom augmentation modules developed to enhance sepsis mortality prediction using ICU datasets. It introduces **FRSSA** (Feature Region Synthetic Sampling Approach), a novel technique combining elements of SMOTE and ADASYN while applying dynamic hardness-based interpolation and expansion dispersion.

The repository supports both:
- **Pre-splitting augmentation** (augmentation applied to full data before train-test split)
- **Post-splitting augmentation** (augmentation applied only to training data)

📈 Method Summary (FRSSA)
FRSSA identifies borderline minority samples using K-nearest neighbors, calculates their hardness level, and then:

Allocates more synthetic samples to harder regions.

Generates synthetic points through controlled interpolation.

Applies optional Gaussian dispersion (in post-splitting) to increase diversity.

This leads to better representation of complex minority class boundaries, especially useful in ICU mortality prediction tasks.
